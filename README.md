# Emotion Recognition

This repository contains code for emotion recognition using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Emotion recognition is an important task in various fields including human-computer interaction, healthcare, and entertainment. This project aims to develop models that can accurately recognize human emotions from various input modalities such as facial expressions, text, and speech.

## Contents

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing the emotion recognition models.
- `models/`: Implementation of different machine learning models for emotion recognition.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment.
- `README.md`: Introduction and overview of the project (you're reading it right now).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/andrei2timo/Emotion-recognition.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the scripts to train the models, evaluate performance, and deploy the models.
